            <h3>Rossignol Experience 80 Ci</h3>
            <p>The Rossignol Experience 80 Ci was the first ski I ever bought for myself once I was done growing so it will always have a place in my heart. The one I ride is 167 cm tall. With a waist of 80 cm, which is where the 80 in the name comes from. It has a honeycomb tip to reduce the swing weight and a partial sidewall to get more grip when you engage in your turns. And it also has carbon inlays which give it a little bit more rigidity while still being pretty light and also offering some springiness into the ski.
