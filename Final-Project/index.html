        <h2>Welcome to Ethan's Skiing Adventures</h2>
        <p class="homepage-p">Hello and welcome to my skiing adventures website. I am using this to publish all my skiing trips and adventures for all to see. I will be showing you all what skiis I have ridden and what I might get in the future. I'm also going to show the mountains and resorts I have been to and say why either I like them or I don't like them. I may also share some reccomendations for skis now that I have started working at a real ski shop.
            <br><br><br>
            Not to leave the readers out of any fun, there is also a submissions page where you can send in a picture of a mountain or skis and talk a little bit on why you like them. Then I will cycle through some and show them right here on the front page.</p>
