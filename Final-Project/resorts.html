            <h3>Roundtop Mountain Resort</h3>
            <p>Address: 925 Roundtop Rd, Lewisberry, PA 17339<br>
            Website: <a href="https://www.skiroundtop.com/" target="_blank"> Roundtop</a></p>
            <p>Roundtop has a lot of great stuff to offer for everyone on the mountain. Wether you are a complete beginner, very experienced or like to do tricks in the park. The mountain has really good progression from not super steep greens all the way up to very step blacks and everything in between. As I find my self wanting to learn to do more tricks and jumps the park is very well maintained.
                The staff have created two lines, one for bigger jumps, and a smaller section for box and rail combos that also has a j-bar. If you don't know a j-bar is a bar in the shape of a 'J' that will pull you up a hill, nothing super big but enough to get you to the top of the park section. And the use of the j-bar is great here because it allows you to go in the park over and over again without going on a real lift.

            <h3>Holiday Valley Resort</h3>
            <p>Address: 6557 Holiday Valley Rd, Ellicottville, NY 1473<br>
            Website: <a href="https://www.holidayvalley.com/" target="_blank"> Holiday Valley</a></p>
            <p>Holiday Valley is a mountain in New York south of Buffalo. It is a lot bigger than most of the mountains I usually ride that are in Pennsylvania and it is a great change of pace. My family and another go on a trip here for a couple days after Christmas and its really fun. The mountain is very large and has a great selection of trails and both a front and backside to the mountain. Although I have not yet visited the park area from what I have seen it has a decent selection, but you can tell that the mountain is more focused on 
                the overall trail experience. Which in the end has really paid off for them. Their trails are amazing, they could be freshly groomed, or have a little bit of powder, they all flow down really well. And Many of the trails offer cut throughs so you can ski half of one trail and half of another. It also a really cool experience off the mountain. With the nearby town Ellicottville you have lots of shops and restaurants to visit once you finish up with your skiing. Overall an awesome time for those who like to ski and then relax on the town afterwards.
