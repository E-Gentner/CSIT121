        <h2>What do you want me to look at?</h2>
        <p class="submission-intro">Here is where you are able to submit things so I can see them. Some examples of what you can submit are:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Skis you have used</li>
            <li>Resorts you have visited</li>
            <li>Skis you want me to feature</li>
            <li>General questions or advice</li>
            <li>Stories you want other skiers to hear</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below is the form you will need to fill out and submit. I will look through the submissions and I will rotate them on the homepage every week. And if you every submit one and I miss it please feel free to send it again, there are no stupid questions of suggestions, I may have just had some that I thought we a little bit better. (Email is not required but helpful if I need to reach out to you.) </p>
