        <h2>Why I Love Cooking</h2>
        <p>I started cooking when I moved out of my house and started living on my own. At first it was
             ready to make meals and stuff that isn't healthy for you. But then I started looking up recipes
              on Google, YouTube, or anywhere that I could find something tasty. Once I found the
               gratification that comes from making something by yourself and eating it and seeing 
               how good it tastes I never went back to bad ready to eat meals again. All in all, I think
                the most fun I've had while cooking was when I visited home and my Father and I made pizza
                 from scratch. It was difficult to make and stretch the dough, but it was so much better
                  than ordering it from a typical store.</p>
