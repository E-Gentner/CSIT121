        <h2>Why I like Linux</h2>
        <p>For most people when they hear Linux, they think of people hacking into servers and being bad
             people. But it's quite different from that. The Linux community is a massive group of people 
             that care about digital security and privacy. Most people who use Linux switched because they
              didn't like the privacy breaches that was coming from big corporations. So, people now 
              use, modify, and create new distros of Linux so that everyone can find something they 
              like. You can build your OS from scratch like a lot or Arch Linux users, or you can 
              get one the hundreds or thousands of other versions based of trusted open source 
              distros and make it yours.</p>
        <p>Personally, I use a distro called EndeavourOS, and the main reason is because it is an Arch
             Linux base allowing me to control things down to smallest detail about the system. But I don't
              have to build it from the ground up like a true Arch user. And all of this may seem very
               confusing to people who have never heard of linux before but once you start using it,
                you understand how to do everything you once did on either Windows or Mac. And that’s 
                why I think everyone should try linux at least once.p>
