                <li>3 Sweet Onion</li>

            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, place the flour, salt, and sugar. Then, in a separate container, hydrate the yeast in the water (98F), and whisk it, set aside.</li>  
                <li>Add the olive oil to the flour, mix it, then add the previously hydrated yeast, mix it by hand until you get a shaggy dough. Clean the excess dough, cover it with plastic and let it rest for 15 min at room temperature.</li>
                <li>Take your dough out, slap, and fold it for one minute or until it begins to turn smooth; cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rest for 15 min.</li>
                <li>Slap and fold one more time for 1 minute, until smooth, roll it into a ball. Grease a surface, place your dough, and cover it with an inverted bowl for 45 min or 1 hour. </li>
                <li>Split your dough into four pieces, around 400g each. Sheet your dough by gathering all the sides and bring them to the center, roll it over in circles, keeping contact with your surface, roll it into a ball, place it in an individual greased (cooking oil) container, and cover it. Place it into the fridge for one to four days.</li>
                <li>Take the dough out, and let it temper for 3 hours. Then, using a couche or a large towel, dust it lightly with rice or all-purpose flour to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Flour the top of your dough, take it out of the container so the floured side is facing down. Lightly press it down to flatten it, forming a rectangle. Fold it in half away from you, brush any excess flour, fold it in half in the same direction one more time, pinch the seams close, roll it over so the seams are facing down, create some tension, rolling it out to tape the ends as you get close to them until your dough is 12 inches.</li>
                <li>Lightly brush the top with some water, roll it in untoasted sesame seeds, coating the top part. Place your dough into the couche, gently fold up your couche, and repeat with the rest of your couche.</li>
                <li>Cover your dough with excess couche, plastic wrap, and let proof for 2 hours. Pre-heat your oven at 500F, and place a baking steel.</li>
                <li>Lightly dust a pizza peel with rice flour or semolina, carefully roll your dough onto the pizza peel. Score the top of your dough using a blade or a lame, place it in the oven, spray the oven with water, after two and a half minutes, respray it, wait another two and a half minutes and spray the dough for the third time. Bake for 12 minutes or until golden brown; remove your hoagie from the oven, cool down in a wire rack, and repeat with the remaining three pieces of dough.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Place the meat in the freezer for 30 minutes (prevent the meat from falling apart when slicing), cut it into thin pieces using a knife or a deli slice. Next, cut the top off, then the bottom part of the onion, peel it and slice it into 1‚Äù pieces. Set up your plancha (or a cast iron), one side medium-high and the other medium-low.</li>
                <li>Fill up half a squirt bottle with vegetable oil and the other half with melted tallow (rendered beef fat). Then, on the hot side of your plancha, squirt some oil, add one-third of your onions; season them with salt, and a small pinch of sugar, saute your onions, stirring and flipping them often for about five minutes, or when they start to caramelize. Next, move the onions to the low heat of your plancha.</li>
                <li>Squirt some oil on the hot side of your plancha, let it heat up, add your beef, season with salt, and sear it, flip it and sear the other side, season with salt and cracked black pepper. Once the meat is seared and cooked through, give it a quick chop with your spatula, add your onions, and mix well.</li>
                <li>Bring everything together and form a rough line, with a shape of a hoagie, three or four slices of Provolone, and let it melt.</li>

                This is my favorite Recipe because I get to make all of it from scratch. And from a young age I have always enjoyed Cheesesteaks,
                so being able to make it all by myself and have it taste so good is one of the main reasons why I love this recipe so much. Even though it might be
                a simple dish you can put your own little spin on it with different cheese or different condiments in it to make it your own.
